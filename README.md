## 📘 Problem Statement
Estimating fair house prices is challenging because it depends on multiple factors such as area, number of rooms, location, crime rate, and pollution.  
The goal of this project is to **predict house prices** using a **Multiple Linear Regression model**.

## 💡 Solution / MVP Description
1. Load dataset from OpenML (Boston Housing Dataset).  
2. Preprocess data (feature scaling and train-test split).  
3. Train a Multiple Linear Regression model.  
4. Evaluate using MAE, MSE, and R² score.  
5. Predict prices for new custom inputs.
